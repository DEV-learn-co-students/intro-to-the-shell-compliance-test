## Summary

Learning to use your command line is crucial to being a programmer. Your terminal is your workbench, get to love it.

NOTE: If you are on a PC and using the Nitrous environment, you can skip this series of lessons and go straight to "Intro to Ruby." Make sure to do the "Intro to Nitrous track" track first!
